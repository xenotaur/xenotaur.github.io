# Anthony Francis
## Robotics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

By day, Anthony Francis teaches robots to learn; by night he writes science fiction and draws comic books. Anthony has been studying artificial intelligence for forty years, and has a quarter century's experience in applying artificial intelligence to information technology in areas including reinforcement learning, robotics, and search. For the past eight years he has worked primarily on robotics, including deep reinforcement learning for robot navigation, principles of social robotics, and language model planning for robot control.
